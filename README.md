# Drop Down Dash

- Simple game board where the player can move a ball left or right using arrow keys and drop the ball into gaps in the rows below. If the ball is dropped into the correct gap, the game continues; otherwise, it ends with a "Game Over"

- Play Game Button in header
- Rules in header
- Restart in header
- Arrows will appear on mobile screens
- Game Over will display score

- Thoughts
- The game will have redux store or context api which will store
  - balls position, rows before ball, rows after(future rows), score, game status
